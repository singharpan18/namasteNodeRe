Multiple Route Handlers - Play with the code

next()

next function and errors along with res.send()

app.use("/route", rH, [rH2, rH3], rH4, rh5);

What is a Middleware? Why do we need it?

How express JS basically handles requests behind the scenes

Difference app.use and app.all

Write a dummy auth middleware for admin

Write a dummy auth middleware for all user routes, except /user/login

Error Handling using app.use("/", (err, req, res, next) = {});
